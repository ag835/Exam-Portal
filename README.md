# Exam-Portal

https://afsaccess4.njit.edu/~rat46/cs490/index.php

Website that allows teachers to make questions, create exams, and autograde students' answers. Students are able to take published exams and view their graded results. I built the autograder as part of a team of three for our Senior project course. Requires conntection to NJIT network to access.
